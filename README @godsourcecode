Hi @godsourcecode,

I noticed that your fork of the MalwareDetectionAPK repository https://github.com/topics/malware-detection?l=c%23 does not reference the original repository https://github.com/topics/malware-detection?l=c%23.

This can make it difficult for others to contribute to the project and for users to stay up-to-date with the latest changes.

To fix this, you can follow these steps:

In your local repository, run the following commands:

git remote add upstream https://github.com/giuseppeFlor/MalwareDetectionAPK.git
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git merge upstream/master
git push origin master

Once you have completed these steps, your fork will be referencing the original repository and you will be able to pull in the latest changes from upstream.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards
